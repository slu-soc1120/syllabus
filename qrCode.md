Attendance check-ins will be collected either in-person or through a simple web-form. Students will need a [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) reader application installed on their smartphone to check-in. These web forms are **time stamped**, so if you sign in 3 minutes after the beginning of class or later, you will be marked as 'late' in the attendance database. This is done automatically by my gradebook, so please see me if you have a concern about how this works or, more generally, if you have a commitment that regularly prevents you from arriving to class on time.

If you do not own a smartphone, you will be able to sign-in with me before class. You should note that attendance check-ins are covered by the course's Academic Honesty policy. Sharing the check-in form with another student or signing in on their behalf are both violations of this policy.
