["course-policies.html", "Section 2 Course Policies", " Section 2 Course Policies My priority is that class periods are productive learning experiences for all students. In order to foster this type of productive environment, I ask students to follow a few general policies and expectations:1 Work each week to contribute to a positive, supportive, welcoming, and compassionate class environment. Arrive to class on time and stay for the entire class period. Silence all electronic devices before entering the classroom. Do not engage in side conversations. This is disrespectful to the speaker (whether me or a classmate), and can affect the ability of others in the class to learn. Be respectful of your fellow classmates. Do not interrupt when someone is speaking, monopolize the conversation, or belittle the ideas or opinions of others. Complete the assigned readings for each class in advance, and come prepared with discussion points and questions. Follow my best practices for using Zoom and Blackboard. The following sections contain additional details about specific course policies related to attendance, participation, electronic device use, student support, academic honesty, and Title IX. These general expectations were adopted from language originally used by Dr. Shelley Kimmelberg.↩︎ "],
["covid-19.html", "2.1 COVID-19", " 2.1 COVID-19 We are in the midst of something very few Americans alive today have experienced before to this degree - a pandemic caused by a highly contagious virus called “SARS-CoV-2.” This virus causes an illness called COVID-19. Not since the fall of 1919 have Saint Louis University students begun a semester quite like this one. I think acknowledging that we are all starting from varying places of exhaustion, stress, and anxiety is critical. To that end, I’ve written an open letter to all of you that I ask you to read before our first class. Please, first and foremost, focus on what matters most and practice self care. Please follow SLU’s guidance both for your own health and for maintaining community. If you are living on-campus, please follow all of SLU’s policies for social distancing and mask wearing. These are critical for our collective safety. If you are off campus this semester, please follow them anyway! Again, my biggest priority this semester is your health and well-being. Please reach out if you want to talk about strategies for managing our “new normal,” if you find yourself struggling, or just need someone to vent to. Alternatively, you can reach out to either the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK or Campus Ministry at 314-977-2425 or campusministry@slu.edu. 2.1.1 Planning for Disruptions While we are starting the semester with many of you in St. Louis, and I am certainly rooting for a semester where you all are able to remain on-campus through Thanksgiving Break, we should recognize that there may be disruptions. For some of you, you may find yourselves quarantined because of an exposure to someone infected with COVID-19. You may become sick yourselves. Changes both on-campus and in the greater St. Louis community may mean changes to how SLU operates and even whether or not you can continue to remain on-campus. Given that these are not abstract concerns, everything laid out here represents a best case scenario for the semester. We may find ourselves needing to change some course policies, reading and assignment schedules, and even teaching modalities based on the challenges we are confronted with this semester. I ask for your patience and your flexibility if and when we do need to make these changes. For my part, I will do my best to stay in touch with you and communicate clearly how these changes will impact our course. One way that I am proactively preparing for disruptions is to add two “flex days” to the syllabus. I do not have any content planned for October 22nd or November 24th. If there is a widespread disruption, such as the need for many of you to move off campus, I will use these flex days as a buffer so that we can adjust our course schedule without changing the basic structure of the course. If we are approaching these dates without having had to use them, I will communicate my plans for both days with you all so that you can plan your time accordingly. You should therefore treat all of the course due dates as provisional. This is my plan as of August 14th, and I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. If another faculty member has to take over teaching my class, there may be changes to course content, teaching modality, and assignments. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Blackboard regularly. I appreciate everyone’s willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together. 2.1.2 Face Masks Since we are meeting virtually, I hope that our class meetings are able to be more relaxed than an in-person course, where face masks and social distancing will be ever present. If you do decide to meet-up with classmates in-person to study for a quiz or work on coursework, it is imperative that you follow SLU’s policies for social distancing and mask wearing. The University’s Interim Policy on Face Masks governs all students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors in all University-owned, leased, or operated facilities. All persons physically present in any such University facility associated with this course shall comply fully with this policy at all times. Masks must be worn before entry to all such University facilities (as well as outdoors on all University property when six feet of distance is unpredictable or cannot be maintained). Saint Louis University is committed to maintaining an inclusive and accessible environment. Individuals who are unable to wear a face mask due to medical reasons should contact the Office of Disability Services or Human Resources to initiate the accommodation process identified in the University’s ADA Policy. Inquires or concerns may also be directed to the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity. Notification to instructors of SLU-approved ADA accommodations should be made in writing prior to the first class session in any term (or as soon thereafter as possible). As the instructor of this course, I shall comply fully with SLU’s policy and all related ADA regulations. Students who do not comply with a request by a SLU instructor to wear a mask in accordance with the University’s Interim Policy on Face Masks may be subject to disciplinary actions per the rules, regulations, and policies of Saint Louis University, including but not limited to the Student Handbook. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including any of the following: dismissal from the course(s) removal from campus housing (if applicable) dismissal from the University Students are strongly encouraged to identify to their instructor any student or instructor not in compliance. Non-compliance may be anonymously reported via the SLU Integrity Hotline at 1-877-525-5669 (or confidentially via the Integrity Hotline’s website. "],
["attendance-and-participation.html", "2.2 Attendance and Participation", " 2.2 Attendance and Participation 2.2.1 General Attendance Policy Attendance and participation are important components of this course. Your expected to attend all class sessions and to arrive before the beginning of class. That said, it is important to recognize that our normal attendance policies are not well suited to a pandemic. If you cannot attend class or arrive on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me beforehand to let me know if at all possible. I define family issues broadly - if your family or friends become sick or are being affected by COVID-19 in other ways, please know that I want you to keep your focus on what is most important. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a health care provider, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for absences. I will not be asking for health care provider documentation for acute illnesses or injuries, though, since if you’re sick but not very sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines. Please see the University’s attendance policy for additional details. 2.2.2 Zoom Policies Since we are meeting virtually via Zoom, there are several additional policies to note: Attending via Zoom is required. There is not an alternative means for completing this course. If you have a concern about technology, internet access, or other barriers to regularly attending class via Zoom, please let me know as soon as possible. If there is a need for some or all of you to change from learning on-campus to learning from home or another location, we will work together to identify strategies for you to successfully complete the course. Do not share Zoom details, including login information, links, and passwords, with anyone outside of this course. Using your camera is strongly encouraged during group discussions, but is not otherwise required. Please keep your microphone muted unless you are actively speaking. Class recordings will be made via Zoom and/or Panopto, and will be posted to Blackboard. Recordings should not be shared outside of class. They will capture whatever is happening on my screen, which may include sharing your name and whatever is actively shown via your webcam. If this presents a privacy concern for you, please let me know as soon as possible. The Course Docs contain some additional tips for using Zoom. Please review them closely. 2.2.3 COVID-19 Specific Policies The following COVID-19 specific policies apply to this course. In general, if you are sick but you feel well enough to attend class, you should continue to attend this class since we are meeting virtually. If you are sick and do not feel well enough to attend class, please let me know as soon as possible! As I have said previously, taking care of yourselves should be your first priority. Students who exhibit any potential COVID symptoms (those that cannot be attributed to some other medical condition the students are known to have, such as allergies, asthma, etc.) shall absent themselves from any in-person class attendance or in-person participation in any class-related activity until they have been evaluated by a qualified medical official. Students should contact the University Student Health Center for immediate assistance. Students who exhibit any potential COVID symptoms (those that cannot be attributed to some other medical condition the students are known to have, such as allergies, asthma, etc.) but who feel well enough to a) attend the course synchronously in an online class session or b) participate in asynchronous online class activities, are expected to do so. Those who do not feel well enough to do so should absent themselves accordingly. Students (whether exhibiting any of potential COVID symptoms or not, and regardless of how they feel) who are under either an isolation or quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official must absent themselves from all in-person course activity per the stipulations of the isolation or quarantine directive. They are expected to participate in synchronous or asynchronous online class activities as they feel able to do so, or absent themselves accordingly. Students are responsible for notifying each instructor of an absence as far in advance as possible; when advance notification is not possible, students are responsible for notifying each instructor as soon after the absence as possible. As a temporary amendment to the current University Attendance Policy, all absences due to illness or an isolation/quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official shall be considered “Authorized” absences (effective August 2020 through May 2021). 2.2.4 Missed Classes Attendance check-ins will be collected either in-person or through a simple web-form. Students will need a QR code reader application installed on their smartphone to check-in if their phone does not support it automatically. The Course Docs contain some additional details and links for learning more about how this works. These web forms are time stamped, so if you sign in 3 minutes after the beginning of class or later, you will be marked as ‘late’ in the attendance database. This is done automatically by my gradebook, so please see me if you have a concern about how this works or, more generally, if you have a concern about regularly being able to arrive to class on time. If you do not own a smartphone, please let me know as soon as possible. You should note that attendance check-ins are covered by the course’s Academic Honesty policy. Sharing the check-in form with another student or signing in on their behalf are both violations of this policy. My priority with attendance is to identify students who may be struggling or in need of additional support. However, because attending class is crucial, I do factor attendance into your overall participation grade. In order to give you some flexibility, I do not apply any penalties to your first two unexcused absences. Any unexcused absences beyond those two will result in no credit (for an absences). Regular late arrivals may result in partial credit being earned for that day’s participation grade. Specific elements of the course, such as participation in group discussions during lectures as well as the QHQ discussions, will also be factored into your participation grade. If there is a need for you to miss a significant portion of your coursework, such as because of an illness, please reach out to me and we will make a plan for alternative ways to make-up these activities based on the circumstances. It is your responsibility to make-up missed classes, including viewing the lecture recording and, if needed, obtaining notes from a classmate All lecture slides will be posted on Blackboard before class begins along with relevant notes for that lecture. Please note that lectures and discussions cannot be recorded by any means (e.g. audio or video recordings, or photographs) without my permission. "],
["communication.html", "2.3 Communication", " 2.3 Communication Email is my preferred method of communication. I dedicate time to email responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically within 24 hours during the workweek. If you have not received a response from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you emailed me over the weekend), please feel free to follow-up with me. Please use your SLU email account when emailing me. All messages regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule including cancellations will be sent to your SLU email account. It is therefore imperative that you check your SLU email account regularly. Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU staff members, and others will not be honored. "],
["electronic-devices.html", "2.4 Electronic Devices", " 2.4 Electronic Devices During class periods, students are asked to refrain from using electronic devices (including cell phones) for activities not directly related to the course. For this class, I expect students to limit their use of electronic devices to accessing Zoom, course readings, notes, and other course materials. There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results in decreased retention of course content (Hembrooke and Gay 2003) and lower overall course performance (Fried 2008). Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view of another student’s laptop also have decreased performance in courses (Sana et al. 2013). Conversely, students who take notes the “old fashioned way” have better performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect that it may have on others around them. I reserve the right to alter this policy if electronic device use becomes problematic during the semester. I strongly encourage you to take notes for this course either on a second device or by hand so that you can make the Zoom window as large as possible. Please let me know by clicking “slow down” in Zoom’s attendee controls or let me know via the chat if you need something repeated or clarified. "],
["student-support.html", "2.5 Student Support", " 2.5 Student Support 2.5.1 Basic Needs If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or lack a safe and stable place to live, you are urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. Likewise if you have concerns about your mental or physical health needs, or lack access to health care services you require, you should contact either the Dean of Students, Student Health Services, or the University Counseling Center.2 If you feel comfortable doing so, please discuss any concerns you might have with me. Doing so is particularly important if believe your performance in this course might be affected. I will do my best to work with you to come up with a plan for successfully completing the course and, if need be, work with you to identify on-campus resources. I will treat all discussions with discretion, though please be aware that certain situations, including disclosures of sexual misconduct or self harm, must be reported by faculty to the appropriate University office. 2.5.2 Academic Accommodations If you meet the eligibility requirements for academic accommodations through the Office of Disability Services (located within the Student Success Center) and you wish to use them for this class, you should arrange to discuss your needs with me after the first class. All discussions of this nature are treated confidentially, and I will make every effort to work with you to come up with a plan for successfully completing the course requirements. Please note that I will not provide accommodations to students who are not working with Disability Services, and that I cannot retroactively alter assignments or grades if they have already been completed. This follows the University policies on disability accommodations: Students with a documented disability who wish to request academic accommodations must formally register their disability with the University. Once successfully registered, students also must notify their course instructor that they wish to use their approved accommodations in the course. Please contact Disability Services to schedule an appointment to discuss accommodation requests and eligibility requirements. Most students on the St. Louis campus will contact Disability Services, located in the Student Success Center and available by email at Disability_services@slu.edu or by phone at 314-977-3484. Once approved, information about a student’s eligibility for academic accommodations will be shared with course instructors by email from Disability Services and within the instructor’s official course roster. Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one also are encouraged to contact to Disability Services. Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries. 2.5.3 Writing Services I also encourage you to take advantage of the University Writing Services (UWS) program. Getting feedback benefits writers at all skill levels and the quality of your writing will be reflected in assignment grades. The UWS has trained writing consultants who can help you improve the quality of your written work. UWS’s consultants are available to address everything from brainstorming and developing ideas to crafting strong sentences and documenting sources. Due to COVID-19, all writing services appointments are occurring either over Zoom or asynchronously. Appointments can be made through EAB Navigate. 2.5.4 Student Success Coaching Academic coaches are staff members who can assist with study skills, time management, test and note taking, goal setting, and motivations. They can also help deal with navigating homesickness, making connections on campus, and being successful in online/remote coursework. Coaches will work with you on a weekly basis to develop the skills that are most important to you. For more information, please contact Emily Tuttle. Due to COVID-19, appointments will be held over Zoom. This language is adopted from text written by Dr. Sarah Goldrick-Rab.↩︎ "],
["academic-honesty.html", "2.6 Academic Honesty", " 2.6 Academic Honesty All students should familiarize themselves with Saint Louis University’s policies the the College of Arts and Sciences policies concerning cheating, plagiarism, and other academically dishonest practices: Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is “the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity.” Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service through which SLU fulfills its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern. Any work that is taken from another student, copied from printed material, or copied the internet without proper citation is expressly prohibited, and will be addressed by the instructor. Collaborating on quizzes, such as taking them in groups (whether in-person or virtually), is also prohibited. Any student who is found to have been academically dishonest in their work risks failing both the assignment and this course. All relevant assignments should include in-text citations and references formatted using the American Sociological Association (ASA) style guidelines. "],
["harassment-and-title-ix.html", "2.7 Harassment and Title IX", " 2.7 Harassment and Title IX While I have every expectation that each member of the Saint Louis University community is capable and willing to create a positive coursework experience, I fully recognize that there may be instances where students fall short of that expectation. Students should generally be aware that: Saint Louis University prohibits harassment because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, military status, veteran status, gender expression/identity, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other characteristics protected by law. All students should also familiarize themselves with Saint Louis University’s polices on bias, discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. In particular, they should be aware of policies on harassment and sexual misconduct: Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, stalking, domestic or dating violence, we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident that involves a Title IX matter, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX Coordinator and share the basic facts of your experience. This is true even if you ask the faculty member not to disclose the incident. The Title IX Coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus. Anna Kratky is the Title IX Coordinator at Saint Louis University (DuBourg Hall, Room 36; anna.kratky@slu.edu; 314-977-3886). If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK or make an anonymous report through SLU’s Integrity Hotline by calling 1-877-525-5669 or online at https://www.lighthouse-services.com/_StandardCustomURL/LHILandingPage.asp. To view SLU’s policies, and for resources, please visit the following web addresses: https://www.slu.edu/here4you and https://www.slu.edu/general-counsel. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported either directly to the instructor or to the University Administration. Consistent with the above policies, I will forward all reports of inappropriate conduct to the Title IX Coordinator’s office or to the Office of Diversity and Affirmative Action. Please be aware that University policies may require me to forward information about the identity of any students connected to the disclosure. Please also be aware that communications over various online services, including (but not limited to) Blackboard and Zoom, are covered by this policy. "]
