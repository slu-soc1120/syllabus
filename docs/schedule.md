### Scheduling Notes

The course schedule may change as it depends on the progress of the class and the [challenges we are confronted by this semester](covid-19.html). The web version of this document will be updated to reflect any alterations, but the `.pdf` version will remain unaltered.

This semester, we will not have class on **February 17** because it is one of the University's break days. Additionally, no class activities are scheduled for **March 10** or **May 10**. These are "flex days," which I have left without a scheduled plan to accommodate changes due to COVID-19. If we have to reschedule class days, these two dates will be used before we begin to remove content from the course plan. I will provide updates on my plans for both of these days as the semester progresses.
