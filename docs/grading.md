# Assignments and Grading
This section provides general details on the different types of assignments for this course. It also contains policies for submitting work, reciving feedback, and late work.

## Assignments
Your grade for this course will consist of a number of different assignments on which points may be earned. Each category of assignment is described below.

### Attendance and Participation

<div class="rmdtip">
<p>Attendance and participation are worth <strong>10%</strong> of your final grade - 5% for the first half of the semester and 5% for the second half.</p>
</div>

As discussed above, both attendance and participation are important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during class, and (c) class "entry" and "exit tickets".

Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit. Your participation grade will be split, with 25 points (5% of your final grade) for the first half of the semester (through Lecture-07) and another 25 points (5%) for the second half. Since the number of points awarded for participation are variable, the total number of points earned for each half will be **weighted** so that it is converted to a 0 to 25 scale. I provide the final number of points earned for each half of the course. If you would like a more detailed breakdown of your participation grade, please reach out and I will provide one.

Attendance check-ins will be collected either in-person or through a simple web-form. Students will need a [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) reader application installed on their smartphone to check-in. These web forms are **time stamped**, so if you sign in 3 minutes after the beginning of class or later, you will be marked as 'late' in the attendance database.

If you do not own a smartphone, you will be able to sign-in with Chris before class. Students should note that attendance check-ins are covered by the course's Academic Honesty policy. Sharing the check-in form with another student or signing in on their behalf are both violations of this policy.

"Entry" and "exit" tickets will be collected via **[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)**. These will only be graded for students who present in class on the day that they were collected. Students without access to a smartphone or laptop should submit their tickets as soon as possible after class on the days the tickets are collected. Beginning and end of the semester activities, like the 'Student Information Sheet' and the 'Speaking Up In Class Survey', are counted as "entry" tickets.
