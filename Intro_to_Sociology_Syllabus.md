# (PART) Syllabus {-}

# Course Introduction

> The function of sociology, as of every science, is to reveal that which is hidden.

**Pierre Bourdieu (1996)**

</br>

This course will survey the field of sociology, stressing important ideas, methods, and results. We focus on health to illustrate the application of sociological ideas. The survey is designed to develop analytic thinking skills. Weekly readings from a text will be supplemented with articles and chapters illustrating topical issues and exercises on the skills and craft of the social sciences.

## Two Courses, One Goal

Students will quickly notice that this course has two numbers. SOC 1120-05 is the "regular" course section, and SOC 1120-05H is the honors section. If you are a [University Honors](https://www.slu.edu/honors/index.php) student, you may enroll in SOC 1120-05H if you wish to take this course for honors credit. Students in the honors section complete additional readings for three of the weeks, write several additional response papers, and give a presentation on a topic of their choice to the class. Additional details are include in the [honors supplement at the end of this document](/honors-overview.html). Both courses have the same goal - to introduce students to the fundamentals of sociology through an emphasis on health and medicine.

## Course Objectives

This course introduces the distinct sociological skills through the lens of health and illness, including:

1.  The ability to recognize and examine social phenomena from multiple perspectives.

2.  The recognition of what constitutes fact based arguments from appropriately designed information gathering.

3.  The ability to understand the sources of attitudes and behaviors from cultures and structures and how they impact the quality of life of different groups in society.

4.  The ability to reflect on the diversity around us and to act in a moral and just manner as citizens of the world.

5.  Developing skills in independent thinking, aesthetic awareness, moral and/or ethical system of values, welcoming diversity, and committing to the value of life-long learning.

## Cultural Diversity Core Requirement

This course fulfills the College of Arts and Sciences core requirement for Cultural Diversity in the United States. The Cultural Diversity in the United States requirement is designed to help students gain a better understanding of the cultural groups in the United States and their interactions. Students who complete a Cultural Diversity course in this category will gain a substantial subset of the following skills:

1.  Analyze and evaluate how various underrepresented social groups confront inequality and claim a just place in society.

2.  Examine how conflict and cooperation between social groups shapes U.S. society and culture.

3.  Identify how individual and institutional forms of discrimination impact leaders, communities and community building through the examination of such factors as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, economic class, age, physical and mental capability, and sexual orientation.

4.  Evaluate how their personal life experiences and choices fit within the larger mosaic of U.S. society by confronting and critically analyzing their own values and assumptions about individuals and groups from different cultural contexts.

5.  Understand how questions of diversity intersect with moral and political questions of justice and equality.

## Google Classroom

**[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)** is a learning management system similar to Blackboard. There are two main areas - the `Stream` and the `About` tabs. The `Stream` contains posts for announcements and assignments. Additions to the `Stream` should be emailed to your student e-mail account automatically. This will be my primary means for communicating with the class as a whole. Assignments posted to the `Stream` allow you to submit work for the course. You can use the `Topics` on the left-hand menu of the `Stream` to filter posts, isolating posts related to assignments, lecture materials, and annoucements among other topics.

You will need an invitation to **Google Classroom** from Chris. Invitations will be sent to all enrolled students before the first class. If you enroll after the first day of class, please let Chris know that you will need an invitation. Inivtations will be sent to your SLU associated Google account, which consists of your *computer login* (e.g. `doej` for Jane Doe) entered as an email - `doej@slu.edu`. The password will be the same as your password used to login to mySLU and SLU computers. Using another Google account for this course is not permitted.

In order to faciliate quick access to course materials, each lecture's section of the [**Reading List**](/lecture-schedule.html) will include a button that links to that lecture's post with lecture slides and notes. The button will look like this for posts that are available:

<div class="open"><a href="#">View on Google Classroom</a></div>

<br>

If the button is red, it means that the post with lecture resources is not yet available on the `Stream`:

<div class="closed"><a href="#">View on Google Classroom</a></div>

<br>

Assignments will also be linked from the [**Reading List**](/lecture-schedule.html) to the relevant post on the `Stream`. These will be noted with a hyperlink in paranetheses that looks like this: (<a href="#">Google Classroom</a>)

## Readings

There are two books required for this course. Each book has been selected to correspond with one or more of the course objectives. The books are:

1.  Abraham, Laurie K. 1993. *Mama Might Be Better Off Dead: The Failure of Health Care in Urban America*. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press. ISBN-13: 978-0226001395; List Price: $20.00; e-book versions available.

2.  Andersen, Margaret, Howard F. Taylor, and Kim A. Logio. 2016. *Sociology: The Essentials*. 9^th^ edition. Independence, KY: Cengage. ISBN-13: 978-1305503083; List Price: $202.95; e-book versions available.

I do not require students to buy physical copies of texts. You are free to select a means for accessing these texts that meets your budget and learning style. If ebook editions (e.g. Kindle, iBooks, pdf, etc) of texts are available, they are acceptable for this course. All texts should be obtained in the edition noted above.

All readings are listed on the [**Reading List**](/lecture-schedule.html) and should be completed before the course meeting on the week in which they are assigned (unless otherwise noted). Full text versions of most readings not found in the books assigned for the course can be obtained using the library's [Electronic Reserves](http://eres.slu.edu/eres/coursepass.aspx?cid=4443) system. The password for the Electric Reserves will be posted on **[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)**.

Many of the readings posted on [Electronic Reserves](http://eres.slu.edu/eres/coursepass.aspx?cid=4443) are peer reviewed journal articles. This means that they are written with an aim to contribute to scientific debates. Their primary audiances are typically health care providers, professors, and graduate students. They are therefore sometimes *difficult* to read. Give yourself time - I don't expect each student to fully understanding the intracacies of each article (especially the statistics included in some), but I do expect you to walk away with a general sense of the argument and evidence presented.

<!--chapter:end:intro.Rmd-->

# Course Policies

My priority is that class periods are productive learning experiences for all students. In order to foster this type of productive environment, I ask students to follow a few general policies and expectations:

1.  Work each week to contribute to a positive, supportive, welcoming, and compassionate class environment.
2.  Arrive to class on time and stay for the entire class period.
3.  Silence *all* electronic devices before entering the classroom.
4.  Do not engage in side conversations. This is disrespectful to the speaker (whether me or a classmate), and can affect the ability of others in the class to learn.
5.  Be respectful of your fellow classmates. Do not interrupt when someone is speaking, monopolize the conversation, or belittle the ideas or opinions of others.
6.  Complete the assigned readings for each class in advance, and come prepared with discussion points and questions.
    
The following sections contain additional details about specific course policies related to attendance, participation, electronic device use, student support, academic honesty, and Title IX.

## Attendance and Participation

Attendance and participation are important components of this course. Your expected to attend all class sessions and to arrive before the beginning of class. If you cannot attend class or arrive on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me **beforehand** to let me know. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for absences. 

A penalty will not be applied to your first two unexcused absences or late arrivals. Any absences or late arrivals beyond those two will result in no credit (for an absences) or only partial credit (for a late arrival) being earned for that day's participation grade.

Making up missed classes are your responsibility, including obtaining notes from a classmate. I do post slides on [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com), but my slides are intended only to serve as references. I do not design slides to serve as a stand-in for not attending class - they are designed to make sense in the context of the lecture as it is delivered. All lecture slides will be posted on Google Classroom before class begins along with relevant notes for that lecture. Please note that lectures and discussions cannot be recorded by any means (e.g. audio or video recordings, or photographs) without my permission.

## Communication

Email is my preferred method of communication. I dedicate time to email responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically within 24 hours during the workweek. If you have not received a response from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you emailed me over the weekend), please feel free to follow-up with me.

Please use your SLU email account when emailing me. All messages regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule including cancellations will be sent to your SLU email account. It is therefore imperative that you check your SLU email account regularly.

Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU staff members, and others will not be honored.

## Electronic Devices

During class periods, students are asked to refrain from using electronic devices (including cell phones) for activities not directly related to the course. For this class, I expect students to limit their use of electronic devices to accessing course readings, notes, and other course materials.

There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results in decreased retention of course content ([Hembrooke and Gay 2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02940852)) and lower overall course performance ([Fried 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131506001436)). Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view of another student’s laptop also have decreased performance in courses ([Sana et al. 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254)). Conversely, students who take notes the “old fashioned way” have better performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops ([Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614524581)).

I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect that it may have on others around them. I reserve the right to alter this policy if electronic device use becomes problematic during the semester.

## Student Support

### Basic Needs

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or lack a safe and stable place to live, you are urged to contact the [Dean of Students](https://www.slu.edu/student-development/dean-of-students/index.php) for support. Likewise if you have concerns about your mental or physical health needs, or lack access to health care services you require, you should contact either the [Dean of Students](https://www.slu.edu/student-development/dean-of-students/index.php), [Student Health Services](https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/student-health/index.php), or the [University Counseling Center](https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/university-counseling/index.php).^[This language is adopted from text written by [Dr. Sarah Goldrick-Rab](https://medium.com/@saragoldrickrab/basic-needs-security-and-the-syllabus-d24cc7afe8c9).]

If you feel comfortable doing so, please discuss any concerns you might have with me. Doing so is particularly important if believe your performance in this course might be affected. I will do my best to work with you to come up with a plan for successfully completing the course and, if need be, work with you to identify on-campus resources. I will treat all discussions with discretion, though please be aware that certain situations, including disclosures of [sexual misconduct](/compassionate-coursework.html) or self harm, must be reported by faculty to the appropriate University office.

### Academic Accommodations 

If you meet the eligibility requirements for academic accommodations through the [Office of Disability Services](https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/student-success-center/disability-services/index.php) (located within the Student Success Center) *and you wish to use them for this class*, you should arrange to discuss your needs with me after the first class. All discussions of this nature are treated confidentially, and I will make every effort to work with you to come up with a plan for successfully completing the course requirements. Please note that I will not provide accommodations to students who are not working with Disability Services, and that I cannot retroactively alter assignments or grades if they have already been completed.

### Writing Services

I also encourage you to take advantage of the [University Writing Services (UWS) program](https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/student-success-center/academic-support/university-writing-services/index.php). Getting feedback benefits writers at all skill levels and the quality of your writing will be reflected in assignment grades. The UWS has trained writing consultants who can help you improve the quality of your written work. UWS’s consultants are available to address everything from brainstorming and developing ideas to crafting strong sentences and documenting sources.

## Academic Honesty

All students should familiarize themselves with [Saint Louis University’s policies](http://www.slu.edu/Documents/provost/academic_affairs/Academic%20Integrity%20Policy%20FINAL%20%206-26-15.pd) concerning cheating, plagiarism, and other academically dishonest practices:

> Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is “the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity.” Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern.

Any work that is taken from another student, copied from printed material, or copied the internet without proper citation is expressly prohibited.

All relevant assignments should include in-text citations and references formatted using the [American Sociological Association (ASA)](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/583/1/) style guidelines. Any student who is found to have been academically dishonest in their work risks failing both the assignment and this course.

## Harrassment and Title IX

While I have every expectation that each member of the Saint Louis University community is capable and willing to create a positive coursework experience, I fully recognize that there may be instances where students fall short of that expectation. Students should generally be aware that: 

> Saint Louis University prohibits harassment because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, military status, veteran status, gender expression/identity, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other characteristics protected by law.

All students should also familiarize themselves with [Saint Louis University’s polices](http://www.slu.edu/general-counsel-home/office-of-institutional-equity-and-diversity) on bias, discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. In particular, they should be aware of policies on [harassment](https://www.slu.edu/general-counsel/institutional-equity-diversity/pdfs/harassment-policy.pdf) and [sexual misconduct](https://www.slu.edu/about/safety/sexual-assault-resources.php):

> Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, domestic or dating violence), we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident of misconduct, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX Coordinator, Anna R. Kratky (DuBourg Hall, Room 36; <anna.kratky@slu.edu>); 314-977-3886) and share the basic facts of your experience with her. The Title IX coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus. 

> If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported either directly to the instructor or to the University Administration. Consistent with the above policies, I will forward all reports of inappropriate conduct to the Title IX Coordinator’s office or to the Office of Diversity and Affirmative Action. Please be aware that University policies may require me to forward information about the identity of any students connected to the disclosure.

Please also be aware that communications over various online services, including (but not limited to) Google Apps and Google Classroom, are covered by this policy.

# Assignments and Grading
This section provides general details on the different types of assignments for this course. It also contains policies for submitting work, reciving feedback, and late work.

## Assignments

\begin{rmdwarning}
Students enrolled in the honors section should see
\href{/honors-overview.html}{Section 6} for additional assignment
descriptions as well as their weighting and final point totals.
\end{rmdwarning}

Your grade for this course will consist of a number of different assignments on which points may be earned. Each category of assignment is described below.

### Attendance and Participation

\begin{rmdtip}
Attendance and participation are worth \textbf{10\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

As discussed above, both attendance and participation are important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during class, and (c) class "entry" and "exit tickets".

Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit. Not attending class or completing an "entry" or "exit" ticket will result in no credit being earned for that element on a given day. Diengagement during class may result in partial or no credit being earned. Late arrivals will result in only partial credit earned for that element on a given day.

Your participation grade will be split, with 25 points (5% of your final grade) for the first half of the semester (through Week 08) and another 25 points (5%) for the second half (Weeks 09 to 16). Since the number of points awarded for participation are variable, the total number of points earned for each half will be **weighted** so that it is converted to a 0 to 25 scale. I provide the final number of points earned for each half of the course. If you would like a more detailed breakdown of your participation grade and/or attendance record, please reach out and I will happily provide one.

"Entry" and "exit" tickets will be collected via **[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)**. These will only be graded for students who present in class on the day that they were collected. Students without access to a smartphone or laptop should submit their tickets as soon as possible after class on the days the tickets are collected. Beginning and end of the semester activities, like the 'Student Information Sheet' and the 'Speaking Up In Class Survey', are counted as "entry" tickets.

### Sociological Experiences

\begin{rmdtip}
Sociological experiences are worth \textbf{10\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Students will be required to complete two sociological experiences and write a short response paper summarizing your own experience. Additional details and a grading rubric are available on **[Google Classroom's](https://classroom.google.com)** 'Stream' under the 'Assignments' topic. "The Bus" will be due on **Monday, October 1^st^** and "The Suitcase" will be due on **Monday, November 5^th^**. Each reflection paper is worth 5% of your final grade.

### QHQ Papers

\begin{rmdtip}
QHQ Papers are worth \textbf{20\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Each student will write a QHQ reflection paper on three chapters (one chapter per discussion period) of *Mama Might Be Better Off Dead* (Abraham 1993). These reflection papers will integrate previous lecture material and readings to understand the cycle of events described in the book. Additional details and a grading rubric are available on **[Google Classroom's](https://classroom.google.com)** 'Stream' under the 'Assignments' topic. QHQ Paper 1 will be due on **Wednesday, October 10^th^**, QHQ Paper 2 will be due on **Wednesday, November 14^th^**, and QHQ Paper 3 will be due on **Wednesday, December 5^th^**. QHQ Paper 1 is ungraded. If it is not turned in or not taking seriously, however, a deduction of 3% will be applied to your final grade. QHQ Papers 2 and 3 each count for 10% of your final grade.

### Exams

\begin{rmdtip}
Exams are worth \textbf{60\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Three non-cumulative multiple choice exams will be given throughout the semester. Each exam will cover the breadth of the material in the course, including readings, lectures, and videos. Exam 1 will be given on **Monday, September 24^th^**, Exam 2 will be given on **Wednesday, October 31^th^**, and Exam 3 will be given during our class's schedule final exam period on **Wednesday, December 12^th^** from 2:00pm to 3:50pm. Each exam is worth 20% of your final grade.

## Submission and Late Work

### Google Classroom Submissions

All assignments must be submitted via **[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)** *as a Google Doc file* unless otherwise noted in the assignment instructions. **[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)** will have submission portals for each assignment in the `Stream` under the `Assignments` topic. Create your file in Google Docs and then use the submission portal to submit the file. Do not upload a `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`, or other file format - you must submit a **Google Doc file**. Once submitted, you will not be able to edit the file again until it is returned with feedback and a grade. Feedback will be returned to students via comments embedded in each Google Doc.

The Google Doc submission policy is in place because it facilitates clear, easy grading that can be turned around to you quickly. Submitting assignments in ways that deviate from this policy will result in a late grade (see below) being applied in the first instance and a zero grade for each subsequent instance. If you have questions about how to use Google Docs or Google Classroom, or believe there has been an issue with your submission, please reach out to me **before** the submission deadline.

### Late Work

Once the due date has passed, any assignments shared will be treated as late. Be advised that Google timestamps submissions, so that even being a few seconds over the due date and time will result in your assignment being marked late. Like arriving late to class, this happens automatically, so please let me know as soon as possible **before** class if you have a concern about a potentially late submission. 

Assignments shared within 24-hours of the due date will have 15% deducted from the grade. I will deduct 15% per day for the next two 24-hour periods that assignments are late; after 72-hours, I will not accept late work. If you cannot submit work on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me beforehand to discuss alternate submission of work. Internet or computer issues are not grounds for missed deadlines. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for absences. 

### Missed Exams

If you cannot attend an exam due to a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me **beforehand** to discuss alternate exam scheduling. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for absences. Unless there is an extreme situation, such as emergency hospitalization, I do not allow students to make up exams if I have not been notified prior to the original exam date.

## Extra Credit

From time to time I may offer extra credit to be applied to your final grade. I will only offer extra credit if it is open to the entire class (typically for something like attending a lecture or event on-campus). If I offer extra credit, I will generally require you to submit a short written summary of the activity within a week of the event to obtain the credit. Papers should be submitted via **[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)**. When offered, extra credit opportunities cannot be made-up or substituted if you are unable to attend the event.

## Grading

\begin{rmdwarning}
Students enrolled in the honors section should see
\href{/honors-overview.html}{Section 6} for their assignment weighting
and final point totals
\end{rmdwarning}

I use a point system for calculating grades. The following table gives the weighting and final point totals for all assignments for this course:

\begin{table}

\caption{(\#tab:unnamed-chunk-7)SOC 1120 Points Breakdown}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lllll}
\toprule
Assignment & Points & Quantity & Total & Percent\\
\midrule
Participation & 25 pts & x2 & 50 pts & 10\%\\
Sociological Experiences & 25 pts & x2 & 50 pts & 10\%\\
QHQs & 50 pts & x2 & 100 pts & 20\%\\
Exams & 100 pts & x3 & 300 pts & 60\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All feedback will include grades that represent number of points earned. If you want to know your percentage on a particular assignment, divide the number of points earned by the number of points possible and then multiply it by 100.

Some of the provided rubrics on **[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)** result in final points for assignments that include decimals. In the event of non-standard decimals (those other than .25, .5, or .75), I will round your grade up to the next standard decimal value (e.g. .25, .5, or .75).

### Conflicting or Incorrect Grades

I will maintain Blackboard's grade center as work is returned via Google Classroom (or, for exams, via hardcopies returned in class). *This will be the only official use of Blackboard this semester.* If you notice a discrepancy between the grade you recieved in class or on Google Classroom and what appears on Blackboard, please let me know as soon as possible. The same goes for any grads reported in Google Classroom that do not match the grade given back in the assignment feedback. In either case, I will default to taking the higher of the two grades as the offical grade.

Since exams and scantrons are handed back in class, I will only consider possible scantron scoring errors that I am made aware of at the end of class on the day that exams are returned. Please make sure to discuss any concerns you have about your scantron with me that day.  

### Final Grades

Final grades will be calculated by taking the sum of all points earned and dividing it by the total number of points possible (500). This will be multiplied by 100 and then converted to a letter grade using the
following table:

\begin{table}
\caption{(\#tab:unnamed-chunk-8)Course Grading Scale}

\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
GPA & Letter & Percent\\
\midrule
4.0 & A & 93.0\% - 100\%\\
3.7 & A- & 90.0\% - 92.9\%\\
3.3 & B+ & 87.0\% - 89.9\%\\
3.0 & B & 83.0\% - 86.9\%\\
2.7 & B- & 80.0\% - 82.9\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
GPA & Letter & Percent\\
\midrule
2.3 & C+ & 77.0\% - 79.9\%\\
2.0 & C & 73.0\% - 76.9\%\\
1.7 & C- & 70.0\% - 72.9\%\\
1.0 & D & 63.0\% - 69.9\%\\
0.0 & F & < 63.0\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Revisions and Incompletes

No chances will be given for revisions of poor grades. Incomplete grades will be given upon request only if you have a "C" average and have completed at least two-thirds of the possible points (330 points). You should note that incomplete grades must be rectified by the specified deadline or they convert to an "F".

# (PART) Honors Supplement {-}

# Honors Overview

This is the supplemental syllabus for the honors section of SOC 1120-05 (i.e. SOC 1120-05H). Students enrolled in the honors section are expected to complete all [readings](/lecture-schedule.html) and [assignments](/assignments-and-grading.html) included in the syllabus and should look to the previous sections [general course policies](/course-policies.html) as well. The following sections detail the additional work expected of students in the honors section.

## In-Depth Seminars

\begin{rmdtip}
Seminar attendance and participation is captured in the Honors
Participation grade, which is worth \textbf{6.25\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

You are expected to complete three seminars over the course of the semester. The goal of the seminars is to go more in-depth on several topics covered during the class and to provide an additional series of venues to develop your analytical and communication skills. Each seminar will consist of three interrelated parts:

1.  in-depth readings,
2.  a group seminar meeting, and
3.  a short response paper.

Seminar topics will be selected by the students as a group, and should align with [the topics listed below](/honors-seminar-topics.html). Consensus on seminar topics should be reached by class on Wednesday, September 5^th^. All students will complete the same seminars. Once the seminars are selected, Chris will provide a list of additional journal articles and book chapters to read. You will be expected to retrieve readings from SLU's Library if they are available there. If they are not, Chris will provide everyone with a `pdf` copy of the readings. Approximately 40 to 50 pages of additional reading per seminar should be expected.

We will schedule a when all students are available to meet together and discuss the assigned readings. Each seminar meeting will occur after the lectures on the seminar topic (ideally later that week or the next week). Chris will coordinate scheduling the seminar meetings, which will take place in one of the Sociology Department's conference rooms. You should come to seminar meetings prepared to discuss the readings themselves and draw analytical connections to the course material from both the related week and prior weeks. Attendance and participation in the seminars themselves will be factored into your participation grade.

### Paper Format

These discussions should inform a response paper written by each student that connects a theme from the in-depth readings to the course as a whole. The paper should be formatted using the following guidelines:

* Times New Roman font
* 12 point font size
* Double spaced
* 1" margins on top, bottom, and sides
* Papers should be three pages in length
* Papers should use in-text, parenthetical citations formatted using American Sociological Association (ASA) standards
* Papers should include a works cited section on a separate page that is properly formatted using ASA standards

### Grading

\begin{rmdtip}
Your papers are collectively worth \textbf{25\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Paper due-dates will be a week after each seminar meeting, and papers will be submitted via Google Classroom. Each response paper will be graded on four elements:

1.  Content (25 points): How well does the paper synthesize information
    from the in-depth readings, other course readings, the course
    lectures, and other course resources such as documentaries (as
    appropriate).
2.  Organization (10 points): How well organized is the paper? Does it
    have an introduction, a conclusion, and a thesis?
3.  Writing (10 points): How well written is the paper? Is it free of
    spelling and grammatical errors?
4.  Citations (5 points): Are citations correctly applied?

Papers are worth approximately 8.33% of your final grade for each paper.

## Presentation

\begin{rmdtip}
Your presentation is worth \textbf{6.25\%} of your final grade

You should pick a topic from [the honors seminar topic list](/honors-seminar-topics.html) that they would like to present on during one of the related class lecture periods. Topic selection for this assignment can occur independently of the selection of seminar topics, and no more than one student can present on a single topic. Once you have settled on a topic, let Chris know. Topics will be "reserved" on a first-come, first-served basis.

With a topic in-hand, you should read ahead and pick *one narrow aspect* of the readings that you want to learn more about and present on. You are *strongly* encouraged to meet with Chris after selecting your narrow focus area to make sure it is appropriate for the assignment. You should complete additional background research on the topic, and put together an (approximately) ten minute presentation that introduces students to the area. Presentation is conceived of broadly here, and you should feel free to search for creative ways to communicate your topic with the class. Again, you are encouraged to meet with Chris to discuss this aspect of the assignment.

Since presentation is conceived broadly, there is not a formal rubric for this assignment. Students will be assessed holistically on how well they communicate their topic to the class.

## Honors Grading

The following point totals supercede the information on the main syllabus under Section 3.4 - "Grading" if you are enrolled in the honors section of SOC 1120.

\begin{table}

\caption{(\#tab:unnamed-chunk-5)SOC 1120 Honors Points Breakdown}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lllll}
\toprule
Assignment & Points & Quantity & Total & Percent\\
\midrule
Participation & 25 pts & x2 & 50 pts & 6.25\%\\
Sociological Experiences & 25 pts & x2 & 50 pts & 6.25\%\\
QHQs & 50 pts & x2 & 100 pts & 12.50\%\\
Exams & 100 pts & x3 & 300 pts & 37.50\%\\
Honors Participation & 25 pts & x2 & 50 pts & 6.25\%\\
\addlinespace
Honors Presentation & 50 pts & x1 & 50 pts & 6.25\%\\
Honors Response Papers & 65 pts & x3 & 200 pts & 25.00\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To keep the points simple, 5 points will automatically be added to the sum of your three repsonse papers so that they total to a possible 200 points (since `65 x 3 = 195`).
